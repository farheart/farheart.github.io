Known GIT for quite a while, and wanna try to setup a blog on GitHub as well. Google searches hint me that Octopress may be a popular choice. However, all on-line tutorials (found so far) told me to install Ruby and Jekyll locally ... (which makes people as lazy as me very reluctant...), until I found this webiste [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages ](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

# Steps

1. Fork [Jekyll Now](http://www.github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
2. Change the repo name from ***Jekyll Now*** to ***YourUsername.github.io*** ([farheart.github.io](https://farheart.github.io/) for me)
3. Browse the blog -- e.g.,  [https://farheart.github.io/](https://farheart.github.io/)
4. Customize -- change the default content to yours
	* `_config.yml`
    * `about.md`
    * `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md`
4. Online editor: [prose](http://prose.io/#farheart/farheart.github.io/tree/master)

***DONE***
